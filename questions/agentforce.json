    ],
    "correct": ["Both A and C"],
    "explanation": "To integrate a custom AI model, you first need to deploy it to SalesForce's AI Platform, and then use the Einstein Platform's features to integrate it with AgentForce. Apex classes can be used for custom logic, but for model integration, the AI Platform is the primary mechanism."
