External Apps uses a fixed price model based on login volume rather than counting individual users, making it suitable for high-volume, low-frequency usage patterns. Customer Community uses traditional per-user pricing. This makes External Apps ideal for scenarios with many occasional users, while Customer Community is better for smaller numbers of users who log in frequently."

This is distinct from regular Customer Community users who don't have roles. This role-based access allows Customer Community Plus users to access records owned by or shared with other users in their same account, similar to how internal users share data, but organized in a partner or customer account hierarchy that plugs into the bottom of the internal role hierarchy."

In Partner Communities, each partner company should have its own role hierarchy branch beneath the account owner in the main Salesforce role hierarchy. This ensures that partners can only see opportunities owned by users in their own company's role hierarchy, even if they're selling to the same account.

    "correct": ["Header and footer design", "Color scheme", "Typography"],
    "explanation": "In Experience Builder, these branding elements can be customized without custom code: 1) Header and footer design, including logo, navigation, and layout; 2) Color scheme, allowing changes to primary, secondary, and background colors; and 3) Typography, including font family, size, and weight for different text elements. Animation effects require custom CSS, component shadows/borders need custom CSS beyond basic theme settings, and login page layout often requires Visualforce customization for significant changes beyond basic branding."

    ],
    "correct": ["Create a ThemeLayout Lightning Component with header and footer markup"],
    "explanation": "The correct approach for creating a custom theme layout with proprietary header and footer design is to create a ThemeLayout Lightning Component. This component should include the HTML markup, CSS, and JavaScript needed for the custom header and footer, with the {!body} expression to indicate where page content should appear. Once developed, this component can be selected as a theme layout in Experience Builder. CSS modifications in Theme Settings only allow limited styling changes, the Theme API with Visualforce isn't the current approach, and WordPress themes can't be imported into Experience Cloud."

    ],
    "correct": ["Use Translation Workbench and language-specific navigation menus"],
    "explanation": "The correct approach is to use Translation Workbench to enable and manage multilingual content, combined with language-specific navigation menus in Experience Builder. Translation Workbench allows for translating labels, components, and content into multiple languages, while Experience Builder's navigation menu component allows creating separate navigation menus for each language. When a user selects a language, they'll see both translated content and the appropriate navigation structure for that language. Creating separate sites would multiply maintenance effort, a custom Language Switcher alone wouldn't address navigation differences, and Site Variations are for page variations not language versions."

    "correct": ["AppExchange themes may require manual updates when Salesforce releases new Experience Cloud features"],
    "explanation": "An important consideration when implementing a third-party theme from AppExchange is that these themes may require manual updates when Salesforce releases new Experience Cloud features. Unlike standard Salesforce components that are automatically updated, third-party themes may need to be updated by the provider or manually adjusted to remain compatible with new Experience Cloud functionality. Third-party themes can be used with Lightning templates not just Visualforce, can typically be modified after installation, and don't automatically disable standard components."

    ],
    "correct": ["Implement a CMS Collection with custom Content Layouts"],
    "explanation": "Implementing a CMS Collection with custom Content Layouts provides the most flexibility with the least custom development for showcasing products in a grid layout. This approach allows storing product information in Salesforce CMS, creating custom layouts for how each product card appears, and using the CMS Collection component to display them in various grid configurations. CMS Collection layouts can be created declaratively while offering significant design flexibility. Tile Menu is too limited for rich product display, custom LWCs would require more development, and third-party grid systems in HTML would be difficult to maintain."

    ],
    "correct": ["Implement page variations with different Theme Layout components"],
    "explanation": "To apply different themes based on user profile, the appropriate approach is to implement page variations with different Theme Layout components. Page variations can be assigned to specific audiences (like high-value customers), and each variation can use a different theme layout component, effectively creating theme variations for different user segments. Multiple sites would be excessive just for theme differences, audience targeting with theme variables has limited capability for comprehensive theme changes, and a custom LWC would require unnecessary development for what can be accomplished with standard functionality."

    "correct": ["Use Salesforce Connect with OData to create external objects from the PIM system"],
    "explanation": "Salesforce Connect with OData is the most appropriate approach for integrating frequently updated PIM data. It creates external objects that map to the PIM system data, allowing the Experience Cloud site to display product information in real-time without copying or synchronizing data. This ensures the information is always current and maintains the PIM as the single source of truth. Batch synchronization would result in outdated information, custom API integration would require significant development, and CMS Connect is for content management systems, not product information management systems."

    "explanation": "Data Category Security is the appropriate feature for restricting knowledge article visibility based on patient health conditions. By implementing data categories for different health conditions and configuring data category visibility settings by profile or permission set, the healthcare provider can ensure patients only see articles relevant to their specific health conditions. Article Type Access Control only restricts by article type not content, Profile-based Article Access is too broad, and Knowledge Article Sharing Rules don't exist as a standard feature."

It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, organizing, and publishing various content types like images, articles, and documents to Experience Cloud sites. It's specifically designed for business users like marketers who need to manage content without technical skills or IT involvement. Static Resources require developer involvement, Rich Content Editor is a component not a content management system, and Knowledge Management is specialized for knowledge articles not general digital content."
